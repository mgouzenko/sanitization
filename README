Homework 3 - Sanitization

Compilation
********************************************************************************

	$ make

This results in a binary called add_file. This binary accepts lines in from
stdin, as per the assignment specs.

Testing
********************************************************************************
Tests are specified by 3 files per test: a .in file, a .out.file file and a
.out.data file. The first file specifies the input to be given as stdin. The
second file (.out.file) specifies the octal dump of the output of the ls
command. I used octal dump so that I could be certain which characters were
being printed. The last file specifies the octal dump of the output of the cat
command on the file(s) produced by add_file. Tests are discovered and run
automatically.
